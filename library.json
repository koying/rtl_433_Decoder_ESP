    "description": "RTL_433 433.92 MHz protocols library for Arduino. With this port of RTL_433 433.92 MHz protocols, you can decode 434 MHz protocols (e.g., rc switches or weather stations) supported by rtl_433. This should help to implement IoT bridges between the 434MHz-RF band and internet protocols. It is developed and tested on ESP32.",
